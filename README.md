Hockey Player Performance Evaluation using Machine Learning and AI-Based Explanatory Agent
Project Overview
This research investigates a robust and data-driven approach for evaluating hockey player performance, specifically tailored to the Sri Lankan context. The primary objective is to create a reliable ranking system that identifies key attributes influencing player performance and leverages machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to predict a comprehensive performance score. Additionally, an advanced chatbot-based explanatory agent was developed to provide personalized improvement recommendations, utilizing modern technologies such as LangChain, OpenAI APIs, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

Key Components
Attribute Selection and Verification
Through literature reviews, expert consultations, and surveys with national hockey coaches, the research identified nine critical attributes impacting player performance. These include skill accuracy, goal times, penalty statistics, and card issuance, among others, forming the basis for data-driven performance assessment.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data was meticulously collected, preprocessed, and explored using statistical and visual analysis techniques to ensure high-quality, standardized input for model training. A rating equation was formulated, integrating the impact of selected attributes on overall performance, and normalized to a 100-point scale.

Model Development
ML and DL models were implemented, drawing on the most relevant architectures to predict player performance scores accurately. Models were evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² to determine the most effective model for performance prediction.

Explanatory Agent Development
An AI-driven chatbot provides players with customized improvement recommendations based on their individual attribute scores and performance outcomes. The agent combines Retrieval Augmented Generation with an intuitive interface to deliver targeted, actionable insights.

Project Structure
Data: Contains datasets collected for research.
Model Code: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for model training, evaluation, and deployment.
Chatbot Code: Backend and frontend code for the explanatory chatbot, including LangChain and OpenAI API integrations.
Appendices: Supplementary materials, such as complete Python code for model implementations and weight calculations.
Key Insights
This research underscores the effectiveness of attribute-based performance scoring in sports analytics. The methodology successfully identified critical performance determinants and demonstrated the value of integrating AI-based advisory systems to support athlete development.

Future Work
Further research could extend this model to include more granular data inputs, such as wearable device metrics, and explore real-time adaptability for player evaluation in live game settings.
